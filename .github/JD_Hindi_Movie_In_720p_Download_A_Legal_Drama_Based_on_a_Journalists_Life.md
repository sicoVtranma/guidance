The Times of India gave it 1.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "The film JD, titled after its protagonistâs nickname Jai Dwivedi, claims to be a film that will show you just how the dark side of the media looks like. However, it is anything but that. Instead, what you have are a handful of leftover cliches from Madhur Bhandarkarâs âPage 3â strung together in a haphazard way." [1]
