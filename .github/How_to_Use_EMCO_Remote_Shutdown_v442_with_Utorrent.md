But did you know that you can also use EMCO Remote Shutdown with Utorrent, a popular BitTorrent client? Utorrent allows you to download and share files over the Internet using the peer-to-peer protocol. However, downloading large files can take a long time and consume a lot of bandwidth and power.
 
That's why you might want to use EMCO Remote Shutdown to schedule your downloads and shutdowns. For example, you can configure Utorrent to start downloading a file at night when the network traffic is low, and then use EMCO Remote Shutdown to shut down your PC when the download is complete. This way, you can save time, energy and money.

8. Click on the Save button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+S to save your task.
