- Explore the presets. TAL-U-NO-LX V2 comes with more than 300 presets by different sound designers, including the original hardware "Factory Bank A". You can browse through them by using the arrows on the top right corner of the plugin interface or by clicking on the preset name and selecting one from the menu. The presets cover a wide range of sounds, from basses and leads to pads and effects. You can use them as they are or tweak them to your liking.
- Use the MPE mode. TAL-U-NO-LX V2 supports MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression), which means you can use a compatible controller to modulate different parameters of each note independently. For example, you can use a Roli Seaboard or a Linnstrument to control the pitch bend, filter cutoff, volume and vibrato of each note with your finger movements. To enable MPE mode, click on the "MPE" button on the bottom left corner of the plugin interface and adjust the settings according to your controller.
- Try the different filter modes. TAL-U-NO-LX V2 has four different filter modes: LP24 (low-pass 24dB), LP12 (low-pass 12dB), HP (high-pass) and BP (band-pass). You can switch between them by clicking on the "Filter Mode" button on the bottom right corner of the plugin interface. Each mode has a different sound and character, so experiment with them and see how they affect your sound.
- Use the arpeggiator. TAL-U-NO-LX V2 has a built-in arpeggiator that can create rhythmic patterns from the notes you play. You can turn it on by clicking on the "Arp" button on the top left corner of the plugin interface. You can adjust the speed, sync mode, range, direction and hold function of the arpeggiator by using the knobs below the button. You can also use the "Arp Mode" button to switch between different arpeggio types: Up, Down, Up/Down, Random and Manual.
- Learn from the manual. TAL-U-NO-LX V2 has a detailed manual that explains all the features and functions of the plugin in depth.
